AwesomeWM Config
================

My configuration files for AwesomeWM.  It was based on [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats) multicolor theme.  Over time I have customized the various features of it to suit my taste.  This readme will eventually contain all the information about it and how it works.  For now this is all I have.

It requires [lain-widgets](https://github.com/lcpz/lain) to work properly.  These add little widgets to the panels of Awesome.  To install, just clone the repo into the awesome config directory, `~/.config/awesome/lain`.
