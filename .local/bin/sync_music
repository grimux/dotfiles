### Help Section ###

	echo "options:"
	echo "h     Print this help screen."
	echo "d     Run rsync in dry-run mode."

### Get user input ###
get_input() {
	# List of devices in simple-mtpfs
	device_list=$(jmtpfs -l)

	# User input, selected with dmenu
	input=$(echo $device_list | dmenu -i -l 5 -p "Choose a device:")

	# If nothing was selected
	if [ -z "$input" ]; then

### Mount phone ###
# When mounting the phone through the following command, the first attempt
# will always fail because there is a pop-up on the phone.  After it is
# allowed, the directory will first need to be unmounted, and then remounted
# using the same command.

	# First attempt will trigger a pop-up on the phone

	# Allow access to your data
	echo "Please tap \"Allow\" on the phone."
	read -n1 -r -p "Press any key to continue..." key

	# Unmount the first failed attempt
	sudo fusermount -u $mount_point

	# Remount, after "Allow" was tapped
	sudo jmtpfs -o allow_other $mount_point
}

### Unmount_phone ###
# Command to unmount an MTP mount point, with root privleges for /mnt directory
unmount_phone() {
	sudo fusermount -u $mount_point

### Check mount point ###
# Simply checking if a directory exists.  This directory is obviously from
# my phone.

		echo 0

### Check if phone is plugged in ###
# PID should be unique to my phone, can be set in variables section.
check_phone_cable() {

	result=$?
	if [ $result -eq 1 ]; then
		echo 0
	else
		echo 1
	fi
}

### Call rsync ###
# Function to wrap all the arguments for rsync.
call_rsync() {

	--delete \
	--size-only \
	--exclude $excluded_files \
	--omit-dir-times \
	--no-perms \
	--recursive \
	--inplace \
	"$music_pc/" "$music_phone"

### Call rsync - dry-run ###
# Function to wrap all the arguments for rsync.  With dry-run enabled
call_rsync_dry_run() {
	rsync \
	--verbose \
	--progress \
	--human-readable \
	--delete \
