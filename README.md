Dotfiles
========

These are all my dotfiles for Linux.  They rely on using a bash alias, `config`.  The alias looks like this:

`git --git-dir=$HOME/.local/share/dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME`

It wraps git in a way to easily keep track of dotfiles.  Dotfiles are also stored locally in the `share` directory.

I'm uploading my dotfiles in order to preserve them.
