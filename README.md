Dotfiles
========

These are all my dotfiles for Linux.  They rely on using `yadm` to manage dotfiles.  Files with `##` in the name are associated with `yadm`.

I'm uploading my dotfiles in order to preserve them.


Awesome WM
----------

There are two configs for my Awesome WM files, `rc.vanilla.lua` and `rc.themed.lua`.  The vanilla theme is the default config file and the themed is the custom lua file provided by [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).  These themes provide many widgets and colorschemes.  They rely on [lain](https://github.com/lcpz/lain), install with the following command:

`yay -S lain-git`

To use one of the `rc.lua` files, just use a symbolic link.
